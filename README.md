# Customer Purchasing Behavior Exploration

## Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing behavior in various stores. The goal is to analyze how factors like promotions and store openings affect purchasing patterns.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess data to handle outliers and missing values.
- Visualize data to communicate findings effectively.
- Answer key questions regarding customer behavior and sales dynamics.

## Key Questions for Analysis

- Are promotions similarly distributed between training and test sets?
- How do sales behaviors change before, during, and after holidays?
- What seasonal purchase behaviors (e.g., Christmas, Easter) can be identified?
- What is the correlation between sales and the number of customers?
- How do promotions affect sales and customer attraction?
- Which stores would benefit from more effective promotion strategies?
- What are the trends in customer behavior during store opening and closing times?
- Which stores operate on all weekdays, and how does this affect weekend sales?
- How does assortment type influence sales?
- What is the impact of competitor distance on sales?
- How does the opening of new competitors affect existing stores?
